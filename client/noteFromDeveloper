----------Regarding Image Uploading and Fetching--------------
------------------------------------------------------------
I have used cloudinary for image storing. If you have your own 
version of cloudinary you should change the url in various 
places for remote image fetching. I have not stored that 
url in a global variable because I will need the image of different
settings on different pages.Here are the files you need to change

1. components/Home/ChatGroups/ChatGroups.js
2. components/Settings/MainProfile/MainProfile.js

---------------------------------------------------------
----------------Possible software break-----------------
--------------------------------------------------------
User image can either be fetched from cloudinary or it is provided
by facebook or google. To differentiate between them I am doing the check
if imageLink includes 'chat-app'. If you change the image upload folder
it might break in some places.

One such file is components/Settings/SideBar/SideBar.js
